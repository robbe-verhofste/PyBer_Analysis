# Analysis Overview

As a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, I was assigned my first big project: analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

# Results

This analysis shows that, throughout the months January-April in 2019, urban areas had significantly higher total fares than suburban or rural areas.
